# rest_api_dmuse_omdb

Objectives:
1) become familair with REST API requests - Datamuse and OMDB in this case
2) become familiar with manipulating/using resulting data
3) use some resulting data to search other again

Currently this program:

1) takes imput from the user (up to 5 words)
2) sends inout to datamuse for 'related topic words'
3) it returns the related topic word and runs in through OMDB to find a title with the topic word in it
4) it returns title, actor, and years to user
5) then it sends that year and the topic word into OMDB again to find another movie from the same year
